simpleweather-screensaver
=======================

  Created by Sergey Zhumatiy (serg@guru.ru) 2011.

This application is based on Cairo analog clock screensaver for GNOME.
(https://launchpad.net/gnome-clock-screensaver)

Google weather service is used. Application cannot automatically detect
your localtion (if you know how to do it - tell me, please).
Use --area switch to set location (moscow,russia is default).


This screensaver shows current playing song name/artist for any d-bus-enabled player.
It shows ONLY songs, which were started while screensaver was started.

Screensaver dims picture and text automatically in the night (from 20.00 to 7.00).
You can change dim hours - see help.

Installation
============

See file INSTALL.

If you use this screensaver in single mode, set /apps/gnome-screensaver/cycle_delay
key in gconf into BIG value, e.g. 10000. It will prevent often restarts and songs
names will be shown correctly.


Requirements: gtk+-2.0 dbus-glib-1 dbus-1 glib-2.0, cairo.
